# listman
playlist manager to make my coworker's lives easier

## dependencies
* Python 3
* PyQT5

## functions
* it opens files and appends it to the playlist, there's no filter so any file can be added although the mediaplayer might not support it.
* drag/drop reordering of files, as well as move selection up/down via buttons
* delete files, only single selection atm.. kind of impractical
* saves on exit

## todo
* multi selection?
