# listman
playlist manager to make my coworkers lives easier

## dependencies
* Python 3
* PyQT5

## functions
* it opens files and appends it to the playlist, there's no filter so any file can be added although the mediaplayer might not support it
* drag/drop reordering of files, as well as buttons to move up/down and Ctrl+Up/Down hotkeys
* delete files, only single selection atm.. kind of impractical, both with button and Delete hotkey
* saves on exit


## todo
* multi selection?
